# 🧪 Playwright E2E Test Suite

This project contains **end-to-end tests** written with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), covering key user flows and validation logic for Conduit app.

---

## 👤 User Types

The tests are structured to simulate interactions from two primary user roles:

1. **Reader** — Unauthenticated user (view-only)
2. **Blogger** — Authenticated user (create/edit/delete access)

---

## ✅ Test Coverage

The suite includes the following test categories:

- **Happy Path Tests**
- **Negative Tests**
- **Security Checks**

---

## 🌐 Supported Browsers

Playwright runs tests across multiple browsers:

- **Chromium** (Google Chrome)
- **Firefox**

---

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

### 🔒 Local `.env` File

For local development, use the `.env` file in the root of your project with the following variables:

For the github action tests that is not advisable for security, we would use the github secrets in the yaml file like the run-e2e-tests.yml file we have in the workflows folder.

```env
homeUrl=
loginUrl=
signupUrl=
newArticleEditorUrl=
articleUrl=
settingsUrl=
authEmail=
authPassword=
invalidEmail=
invalidPassword=
```

---

## 🚀 **Running tests**

1. Add your valid login credentials in the .env file for below fields below:

- authEmail=
- authPassword=

2. Then open your terminal and enter the below command to run tests:

- npx playwright test (headless mode)

OR

- npm run test:headed (headed mode)

3. Once tests are done you can view the terminal listed results or html report.

---

## 🧵 **Concurrency**

The tests are running on 2 workers for quicker test runs. This can be increased for performance reasons etc.

---

## 🔔 **Notifications on test failures**

We added slack notification script in the run-e2e-tests.yml file with below base message copy:

- Passed message: Great, the e2e tests passed in ...
- Failed message: You have failed tests in ...
